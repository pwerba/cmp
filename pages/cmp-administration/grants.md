### NIH Biographical Sketch (aka Biosketch)

Biosketches are used to convey information about the qualifications, productivity, and the role of the personnel involved in the proposed project.&nbsp; This information is available to peer reviewers as well as NIH extramural program and grants management officials. Information in the Biosketch is factored into the overall merit and technical rating for each grant application.

Unless otherwise stated in the Program Announcement, Biosketches are required for the PI(s), all Key Personnel and Other Significant Contributors (OSC). Consultants are required to include a Biosketch if they are designated by the PI(s) as Key Personnel.
