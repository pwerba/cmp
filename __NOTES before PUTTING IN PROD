__NOTES before PUTTING IN PROD	

1) Edit the _config.yml file in root dir, and change the path of the production URL to your own.

2) Edit the CNNAME file in root and change it.

3) Add the correct analytics code  

4) Replace my typekit credentials with yours, in:
	_includes/themes/mungbean/default.html

5) Make special note that making an email address requires this syntax

 <span class="e">kerri.santos / ucsf, edu </span>

The jquery will process this and translate it in the browser as:

<a href="mailto:kerri.santos@ucsf.edu " class="e-mail">kerri.santos@ucsf.edu </a>

......

FINALLY:

Move this file out of git.
