To do:

ensure bullets are good in all lists.


ensure on bio page, it checks if there is content for a field (fax:, about:, etc) before drawing anything.



clean the content on:
 teaching page , 
 students,
 postdocs,
 fellows
 grants
 cmp admin pages
 (and see if there are any else)

add the rss pull feature thingy.

favicons.
create a page that just lists blog entries.




Experiment with styling an image caption (using html5 caption) into the slideshow. Or using another slideshow. The aliased text is too blurry.



- tell shawn i think the Research and Administration headings on the front page, if they are to remain there, should be links

__NOTES before PUTTING IN PROD	

1) Edit the _config.yml file in root dir, and change the path of the production URL to your own.

2) Edit the CNNAME file in root and change it.

3) Add the correct analytics code  

4) Replace my typekit credentials with yours, in:
	_includes/themes/mungbean/default.html

5) Make special note that making an email address requires this syntax

 <span class="e">kerri.santos / ucsf, edu </span>

The jquery will process this and translate it in the browser as:

<a href="mailto:kerri.santos@ucsf.edu " class="e-mail">kerri.santos@ucsf.edu </a>

......

FINALLY:

Move this file out of git.
