To do:

the bullets in the footer look ridiculous.

the blog layout is too lopsided on the right. the distance between the date and h1 is too great.

make date visible in dropdown menu.

improve date and headline font in block on front page

make a #ccc color UCSF logo for the header so it looks good on #f7f7f7 and charcoal

Experiment with styling an image caption (using html5 caption) into the slideshow. Or using another slideshow. The aliased text is too blurry.

finish styling the bio #details section

Add bio content.

- tell shawn i think the Research and Administration headings on the front page, if they are to remain there, should be links

__NOTES before PUTTING IN PROD	

1) Edit the _config.yml file in root dir, and change the path of the production URL to your own.

2) Edit the CNNAME file in root and change it.

3) Add the correct analytics code  

4) Replace my typekit credentials with yours, in:
	_includes/themes/mungbean/default.html

5) Make special note that making an email address requires this syntax

 <span class="e">kerri.santos / ucsf, edu </span>

The jquery will process this and translate it in the browser as:

<a href="mailto:kerri.santos@ucsf.edu " class="e-mail">kerri.santos@ucsf.edu </a>

......

FINALLY:

Remove this file!
