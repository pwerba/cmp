To check/discuss:
        
Kruidering bio page: text says 'link given above' -- there is none
Front page: administration paragraph says 'search this Web Site'
- tell shawn i think the Research and Administration headings on the front page, if they are to remain there, should be links
Contact page: gave #map a max-height instead of height. ok?


/* misc

__NOTES before PUTTING IN PROD	

1) Edit the _config.yml file in root dir, and change the path of the production URL to your own.

2) Edit the CNNAME file in root and change it.

3) Add the correct analytics code  

4) Replace my typekit credentials with yours, in:
	_includes/themes/mungbean/default.html

5) Make special note that making an email address requires this syntax

 <span class="e">kerri.santos / ucsf, edu </span>

The jquery will process this and translate it in the browser as:

<a href="mailto:kerri.santos@ucsf.edu " class="e-mail">kerri.santos@ucsf.edu </a>

......

FINALLY:

Move this file out of git.
