                <description>&lt;h1 id='mr_f'&gt;Mr. F&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Spanish for &amp;#8220;I know you speak English?&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t understand the question, and I won&amp;#8217;t respond to it. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn&amp;#8217;t that mean anything anymore? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='exit_strategy'&gt;Exit Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&amp;#8217;t like his trailer. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&amp;#8217;t date magicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a hug, Michael. I&amp;#8217;m hugging you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Well, what do you expect, mother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id='let_em_eat_cake'&gt;Let &amp;#8216;Em Eat Cake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you&amp;#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right. There&amp;#8217;s only one man I&amp;#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&amp;#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&amp;#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Really? Did nothing cancel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id='afternoon_delight'&gt;Afternoon delight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across from where? I don&amp;#8217;t criticize you! And if you&amp;#8217;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. What&amp;#8217;s Spanish for &amp;#8220;I know you speak English?&amp;#8221; Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&amp;#8217;t date magicians. Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s called &amp;#8216;taking advantage.&amp;#8217; It&amp;#8217;s what gets you ahead in life.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Guy&amp;#8217;s a pro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id='good_grief'&gt;Good Grief!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to these, because it&amp;#8217;s the last time! No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer&amp;#8217;s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. That&amp;#8217;s why you always leave a note! Say goodbye to these, because it&amp;#8217;s the last time! What&amp;#8217;s Spanish for &amp;#8220;I know you speak English?&amp;#8221; As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; switch) to see your changes! To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='highlight'&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class='ruby'&gt;&lt;span class='k'&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='nf'&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='nb'&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class='nb'&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='s2'&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='si'&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='nb'&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='si'&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='s2'&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='k'&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='n'&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='s1'&gt;&amp;#39;Tom&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='p'&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='c1'&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &amp;#39;Hi, Tom&amp;#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                <description>&lt;p&gt;Development of Novel Tools to Study Signal Transduction Research in our laboratory is focused on the development of novel chemically based tools to decipher signal transduction pathways on a genome-wide scale. We believe that small-molecule based methods for decoding cell-biology could provide information not currently accessible through solely genetic and biochemical techniques. The key problem with using chemicals (small-molecules) to control processes inside cells is that there are very few molecules that are highly specific for the most interesting proteins. Presently, small-molecules which alter the enzymatic activity or cellular localization of key biological macromolecules are derived from two sources: natural product screening (eg. Taxol, FK506, staurosporine, and others) and drug development efforts (eg. Aspirin, Raloxifine, SKB203580, and others). These two approaches require large commitments of time and resources to find even one specific inhibitor. Our lab has developed a third method for producing these valuable reagents using an approach combining protein design and chemical synthesis. We use protein design to engineer a functionally silent yet structurally significant mutation into the active site of the protein of interest. This mutation could be the substitution of a conserved large residue in the wild-type enzyme for a smaller residue thus creating a new &amp;#8220;pocket&amp;#8221; in the active site. The mutant enzyme is then tested in a relevant cellular system to ensure that it functions in all aspects like the wild-type enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is the initiation of a chemical design and synthesis project to modify a non-specific inhibitor of the wild-type enzyme with substituents which specifically complement the mutation introduced into the active site of the protein of interest. Substituents with the appropriate chemical functionality that bind to the newly introduced pocket are chemically appended to the origininal inhibitor structure. Importantly, the new substituent is designed to preclude binding of the inhibitor to any wild-type enzymes because they would &amp;#8220;bump&amp;#8221; into the large residue in the wild-type enzyme. This makes choosing a residue that is conserved in the entire protein family critical for the success of the method. We first applied our approach to deciphering the functions of protein kinases. The protein kinases comprise the largest single gene family in the human genome and are components of the signaling apparatus of almost every key cellular response pathway. Using our combined chemical genetic approach we have developed the first method for identifying the direct downstream substrates of protein kinases. Additionally we have developed extremely potent inhibitors of individual protein kinases that are cell permeable and function in transgenic mice. These inhibitors can be used to inhibit any suitably engineered protein kinase to ellucidate the downstream response pathway controlled by that kinase. We are also currently extending our efforts to other large superfamilies of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways for which specific inhibitors are not available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                <title>Henry Bourne</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bourne received his MD degree from Johns Hopkins and took his postdoctoral training at the National Institutes of Health and UCSF. He came to UCSF in 1969, became a faculty member in the Department of Medicine in 1971, and served as chair of the Department of Pharmacology from 1984 to 1992. Dr. Bourne’s research for many years focused on trimeric G proteins and G protein coupled receptors. During the past five years he has turned his laboratory’s efforts toward dissecting the cellular signals responsible for polarity and direction-finding (chemotaxis) of human leukocytes. Using HL-60 leukemia cells, which can be induced to differentiate into mature neutrophils, Dr. Bourne’s laboratory has shown that attractants trigger polarity by activating opposed “frontness” and “backness” signaling pathways, mediated by different trimeric G proteins and Rho GTPases. These pathways trigger different actin assemblies, which then ‘self-organize’ to create cellular polarity. This polarity is apparently distinct from the neutrophil ‘compass’, which senses and interprets attractant gradients to orient the direction of polarity. At present the laboratory is focusing on the compass mechanism, using drugs, toxins, and RNAi to alter functions of candidate compass components and assessing their effects in attractant gradients created by micropipettes or in microfluidic devices, which create instantaneous, stable gradients of any desired slope or concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
