   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Molecular Logic of Cellular Signaling Systems Signal transduction Protein-protein recognition Protein switches and networks Signaling protein and network evolution Systems biology Biological computation Synthetic biology Livings cells process vast amounts of environmental information to generate sophisticated responses such as movement, growth, and differentiation. Such decisions are made by complex networks of signal transduction proteins. One of the most challenging problems in modern biology is understanding how these networks of proteins act to carry out these remarkable behaviors. A striking commonality among eukaryotic signaling molecules is that they are composed of modular domains. Some domains carry our catalytic functions, but most mediate specific protein-protein interactions. This modular organization of signaling proteins suggests that a common toolkit of components has been used in a combinatorial fashion to evolve the complex signaling proteins and pathways we see today. We are therefore interested in understanding the logic by which simple protein components can be used to build complex information processing systems. We would like to answer this question at several hierarchical levels: 1. How do isolated protein interaction modules function? 2. How have modular domains been combined through evolution to build signaling switches and devices, capable of complex behavior such as high specificity communication, signal integration, and feedback control? 3. How are individual signaling proteins linked into networks that display complex and highly specific systems input/output behaviors? 4. Can we engineer synthetic signaling pathways that rewire and systematically alter cellular behavior? We are probing these questions by studying kinase and GTPase pathways involved in controlling cell movement and stress responses in yeast and mammalian cells. To achieve these goals we take a highly interdisciplinary approach that incorporates diverse techniques including: Mechanistic biochemistry Biophysical methods X-ray crystallography, NMR Molecular biology Cell biology Yeast genetics Protein, pathway engineering&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vale received a B.A. degree in biology and chemistry from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a Ph.D. degree in neuroscience from Stanford University. His postdoctoral studies at the NIH Marine Biological Laboratory were on microtubule-based motors. Dr. Vale has been at UCSF since 1986 and currently is a Professor and the Chair of the CMP department. Dr. Vale also holds appointments as Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the W. K. Hamilton Distinguished Professor in the Dept. of Anesthesia (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on how cells move organelles, proteins, chromosomes and mRNAs within their cytoplasm. Much of this motion is generated by .molecular motors. (termed kinesins and dyneins) that carry numerous cellular cargoes along polymeric tracks called microtubules. Using a variety of techniques (including single molecule motility assays, enzymatic assays, x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and protein engineering), we are dissecting the mechanism by which these nanometer-scale machines convert chemical energy into mechanical work. We also are interested in how the motor proteins and many other proteins in the cytoskeleton contribute to complex cell behavior, such as membrane organization, cell shape, and cell division. As part of such studies, we reconstitute aspects of cytoskeletal function in vitro, visualize the dynamics of cytoskeletal motors in living cells, and examine how cells respond to knockdowns of specific proteins. We also are using sensitive microscopic imaging techniques to study the behavior of single cytoskeletal or signaling molecules within living cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is generally accepted that enduring changes in synaptic strength play a critical role in learning and memory. Long term potential (LTP), a phenomenon in which brief repetitive activation of excitatory synapses results in a long lasting enhancement in synaptic transmission, is the leading cellular model for learning and memory. After more than a decade of debate, there is now a consensus that the change in synaptic strength during LTP resides in the postsynaptic density (PSD). More specifically accumulating evidence indicates that LTP recruits AMPA receptors to the synapse. This research into synaptic plasticity has challenged the classical view of the synapse, in which receptors are firmly embedded in a rigid thicket of proteins in the PSD. Rather, the remarkably dynamic property of AMPA receptors rivals that usually associated with the presynaptic side of the synapse. In striking contrast, NMDA receptors, which intermingle with AMPA receptors, are relatively fixed components of the PSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What accounts for the remarkable difference in the regulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors? I, in close collaboration with David Bredt, have identified two proteins that play an essential role in AMPA receptor trafficking and plasticity; PSD-95 and the tetraspanning membrane protein stargazin. The properties of PSD-95 make it an ideal candidate for determining the number of AMPA receptors that reside at a synapse. Stargazin, which binds both to PSD-95 and AMPA receptors, serves as the bridge. Furthermore, phosphorylation of stargazin plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity. Stargazin is a member of a family of closely related brain specific proteins. Our current research is focused on establishing whether our model can be extrapolated to all excitatory synapses in the CNS, to understand the topology of the stargazin/AMPA receptor interaction, and to determine how phosphorylation of stargazin controls synaptic strength.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My research group is involved in the generation and analysis of large-scale, quantitative genetic and protein-protein interaction maps in a variety of different organisms, including S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and E. coli. We primarily employ a systematic affinity tagging/purification/mass spectrometry approach to identify protein complexes and our E-MAP (epistatic miniarray profile) methodology is utilized to generate quantitative genetic interaction maps. We integrate this information together using a variety of analytical tools that we have developed and are also involved in creating appropriate software that allows for visualization of these large datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use this information to generate testable hypotheses on a number of different processes, including RNA processing, DNA replication and chromatin function. These unbiased approaches have led to the discovery of many exciting and unanticipated connections between many different functional pathways and biological processes. We are also applying global and unbiased approaches and methodologies to the study of pathogenic organisms to further understand how they “hijack” human cells. It is being increasingly recognized that such approaches may be necessary for breakthroughs in effective anti-pathogen strategies, where host-pathogen interactions have proven to be multifunctional and more complicated than expected. Initially, we are focusing our attention on two organisms that are becoming more problematic worldwide: HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). For instance, using our affinity tagging/purification mass spectrometry strategy, we are systematically identifying all HIV-human protein-protein interactions. To this end, we have purified all 18 proteins and polyproteins associated with this virus from two different cell lines (HEK293 and Jurkat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a novel scoring system, we have identified 497 high confidence HIV-human protein-protein interactions, the vast majority of which have not been previously described. We are also following up on several unanticipated, interesting connections between HIV factors and the pathways they hijack. For example, we have found that HIV protease cleaves several host factors, including a component of a translational initiation complex, which is involved in inhibiting HIV replication. Furthermore, we have found a new component of the Cul5 ubiquitin ligase complex that is hijacked by the HIV accessory factor Vif, which is required for its function and HIV infectivity, and has allowed us to reconstitute an active hexameric protein complex. Furthermore, we are transferring our genetic approach, termed E-MAP, to the study of infectious disease. To this end, we are developing methodology that will allow, for the first time, generation of cross-species, host-pathogen genetic interaction maps. This approach will identify which factors are functioning together within the pathogenic organism and which set of genes are re-wired in the host after infection. Since these unbiased and systematic approaches often identify key proteins that link together different processes, we feel these proteins would be enriched for being suitable drug targets. Identifying these proteins using traditional, hypothesis-driven research, in many cases, would be incredibly difficult.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brinen received a B.A. degree in chemistry from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut, and a Ph.D. degree in chemistry from Cornell University. Her postdoctoral studies at UCSF were on structural studies of lung surfactant proteins and serine proteases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brinen co-lead one section of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics, a NIH NIGMS Protein Structure Initiative Structural Genomics consortium at Stanford University/Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory before joining CMP at UCSF in June of 2003. Dr. Brinen is also the Director of Structural Biology at the UCSF Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research focuses on using structural biology, specifically X-ray crystallography, to ask and answer questions in biologically relevant systems. Of particular interest are proteolytic enzymes: the understanding of their function, the regulation of their activity and the structure-guided design of their specific inhibitors. Molecular level structures, particularly when used in concert with enzymological and cell- or animal model studies, provide a framework for advancing the specificity, efficacy and deliverability of potential therapeutic agents for the diseases in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease-based systems studied include Chagas’ disease, also known as American Trypanosomiasis; African Trypanosomaisis, also known as Sleeping Sickness; Malaria; Toxoplasmosis; Fasciolosis, also known as liver fluke infection, and Amoebic Dysentery. A new area of study in the lab focuses on the roles of proteases in allergy-based systems and includes human dust mite allergy and human feline allergy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molecular modeling experiments are often performed in advance of structure availability as these studies often yield significant insight into observed kinetic patterns and can be of use in designing expression constructs most suitable for crystallization. All structural biology projects in the laboratory benefits from the recent and ongoing developments in high-throughput structural biology technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Brinen lab endeavors to streamline the process from gene to three-dimensional structure by using portable high-throughput technologies in the home laboratory as well as making full use of community-available cutting edge technologies at both the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL/SLAC) and the Advanced Light Source (ALS/LBNL Berkeley).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation by Intracellular Receptors We study the activity of the intracellular receptors (IRs), including receptors for glucocorticoids (GR), androgens (AR) and thyroid hormone (TR), in signal transduction and transcriptional control. These hormone-receptor complexes bind to specific DNA sequences termed hormone response elements, which enhance or repress linked promoters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to understand the molecular and cellular logic by which IRs integrate multiple signaling inputs to produce specific, distinct and coherentresponses. We have defined IR domains for hormone and DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, phosphorylation, interaction with various cellular factors and transcriptional regulation. IRs functions faithfully when expressed in simpler organisms such as yeast and Drosophila, thus facilitating genetic analyses of their actions and identification of other factors involved in its activities. Studies of IRs in C. elegans permit analyses of developmental and physiologic control by these factors in an experimentally accessible metazoan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also pursuing 3D structure analyses of various domains of the receptor, and we employ biochemical strategies with purified components for mechanistic analyses. Thus, using genetic, structural, molecular and biochemical approaches, we use IRs as &amp;#8220;biological probes&amp;#8221; to define how a single regulatory protein can specify diverse patterns of specific gene expression in different cellular contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These reductionist strategies can increasingly be applied to studies of complex physiological and pathological processes. For example, we are pursuing: (a) a signaling &amp;#8220;crosstalk&amp;#8221; pathway in developing T-cells in which activation of the T-cell receptor abrogates glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis; (b) dramatic shifts in AR activity and ligand responses during prostate cancer ontogeny and progression; (c) the consequences of glutamine repeat expansion in AR, leading to motor neuron degeneration in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Proteomics, Protein Folding, and Prion-Based Inheritance in Disease and Normal Biology Summary: Jonathan Weissman is looking at how cells ensure that proteins fold into their correct shape, as well as the role of protein misfolding in disease and normal physiology. He is also developing methods for assaying the entire complement of proteins derived from an organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure proper folding, cells have evolved a sophisticated and essential machinery of proteins called molecular chaperones that assist the folding of newly made polypeptides. The importance of proper protein folding is underscored by the fact that a number of diseases, including Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s and those involving infectious proteins (prions), result from protein-misfolding events. My research focuses on identifying and understanding the machinery necessary for efficient folding, as well as studying the mechanism and consequences of protein misfolding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanism of GroEL and Its Eukaryotic Homologs Chaperonins, such as Escherichia coli GroEL, are large ring structures that aid folding of a wide variety of proteins in the cytosol of all organisms. The long-term goal of our chaperonin studies is to understand the physical basis by which chaperonins assist folding, as well as how the particular &amp;#8220;cocktail&amp;#8221; of chaperones present in a given cell helps determine the spectrum of proteins that can fold. My studies with Arthur Horwich (HHMI, Yale University School of Medicine) revealed a remarkable mechanism in which GroEL inhibits aggregation by providing a protected environment where folding can occur while a polypeptide remains sequestered within the GroEL central cavity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to inhibiting aggregation, however, chaperonins can also actively catalyze folding of some proteins. Intriguingly, different chaperonins vary greatly in their ability to promote folding of a given substrate. To understand the basis and extent of the chaperonin substrate spectrum, we used rounds of selection and DNA shuffling to obtain GroEL and GroES variants that dramatically enhance folding of a single substrate—green fluorescent protein (GFP). These findings suggest a surprising plasticity of GroEL and GroES, which can be exploited to aid folding of recombinant proteins. Our studies also reveal a conflict between specialization and generalization of chaperonins, as increased GFP folding comes at the expense of the ability of GroEL and GroES to fold their natural substrates. This conflict and the nature of the ring structure may help explain the evolution of cellular chaperone systems. We are exploring this question by expanding the repertoire of substrate-optimized chaperones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein Folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum The ER is a highly specialized folding compartment responsible for the structural maturation of all secreted proteins. The long-term goal of our ER studies is to understand how the ER maintains an environment that supports folding. To support efficient disulfide formation, the ER must closely regulate its redox potential. Although the chemical requirement for an oxidizing environment has been appreciated for over 30 years, the mechanism by which this is accomplished was unknown. Our studies demonstrated that there is a specific cellular redox machinery required for disulfide-linked protein folding in the ER and identified Ero1p, a novel and ubiquitous protein, as an essential component of this machinery. Recently we have succeeded in reconstituting Ero1p-mediated oxidative folding in vitro with pure components. Strikingly, despite the strong parallel between the oxidative-folding machinery in eukaryotic ER and bacterial periplasm, our results establish that the underlying biochemical mechanisms are unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To obtain a more global view of how efficient folding is achieved in the ER, we have exploited DNA microarray &amp;#8220;chips&amp;#8221; to examine the transcriptional response to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Our studies dramatically changed the view of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Rather than primarily up-regulating molecular chaperones, the UPR results in a concerted reorganization of the ER, altering polypeptide flux from the cytosol to ER, retrograde export from the ER, transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi, and retrieval of ER proteins from the Golgi. We are extending our studies of the regulation of protein folding in the ER to metazoan systems by combining traditional cell biological and biochemical techniques with genomic approaches, including microarrays and comprehensive RNA interference libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanism of Amyloid Formation and Propagation In contrast to the more frequently observed disordered aggregates, some proteins form ordered aggregates, termed amyloid fibrils, that accumulate in a number of human diseases. Our goal is to provide a mechanistic understanding of how amyloid fibers propagate, to elucidate how molecular chaperones control amyloid growth in vivo, and to determine the role of amyloid formation in both disease and normal physiology. Efforts to understand amyloid propagation have been hampered by the lack of a facile genetic or biochemical system for studying this process. This situation has improved greatly with the finding that the &lt;span&gt;URE3&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;PSI+&lt;/span&gt; states of yeast result from the prion-like aggregation of endogenous proteins. My laboratory has taken advantage of the PSI phenomenon to identify and characterize properties of the protein Sup35p that allow it to propagate a ?-sheet–rich prion form. We are now establishing a more general set of tools for studying amyloid formation of disease-related proteins in yeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our studies also suggest that a common mechanism underlies the prion-like propagation of PSI and polyglutamine-mediated pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. More recently, our research on the physiological role of PSI argues that rather than being pathogenic, the PSI prion is an evolutionarily selected mechanism of inheritance. Finally, we have exploited our conservation and mutational data on Sup35p to develop algorithms for searching genomic databases for novel prion-forming proteins. Proteomics: Determining Function, Localization, Abundance, and Noise in the Yeast Proteome The development of microarray technology has revolutionized biology by making it possible to quantitate the abundance of mRNAs. RNA messages, however, are imperfect proxies for the information that is more directly related to function, such as the abundance and activity of the proteome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Erin O&amp;#8217;Shea (HHMI, University of California, San Francisco), we are developing methods that allow us to determine the function, localization, and abundance of the complete complement of proteins in an organism. Our initial efforts have focused on the production of two comprehensive yeast libraries in which we attach a carboxyl-terminal tag to each gene in its native chromosomal context. The collections consist of ~6,000 yeast strains, each expressing a single protein fused to either the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag, which provides an extremely high affinity epitope tag, or to the GFP, which allows us to monitor protein localization. In collaboration with the O&amp;#8217;Shea lab, we have used these collections to determine the localization and abundance of the yeast proteome. Our labs are now focusing on a range of subjects, including following the regulation of protein abundance across the cell cycle, the lifetime of each protein, and the level of expression &amp;#8220;noise,&amp;#8221; as assessed by the cell-to-cell variations in protein levels. This work is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the Searle Scholars Program.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

His postdoctoral studies were done at Stanford University Medical School, Department of Biochemistry. Dr. Wells was the founding member of the Protein Engineering Department at Genentech, Inc where he worked for 16 years. His research focused on designing new functional properties into enzymes and hormones and developing new technologies for engineering proteins. In 1998, Dr. Wells founded Sunesis Pharmaceuticals where he served as President and Chief Scientific Officer and developed a novel fragment discovery technology known as disulfide trapping or Tethering. In 2005, Dr. Wells joined UCSF as the Harry W. and Diana Hind Distinguished Professor in Pharmaceutical Sciences. He is a joint Professor in the Departments of Cellular &amp;amp; Molecular Pharmacology, and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are interested in the discovery and design of small molecules that trigger or modulate cellular processes in inflammation and cancer. Our research spans the multiple disciplines of biophysics, cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry and chemistry. We are interested in the allosteric “circuitry” in proteins, i.e., how two distant functional sites communicate through a protein. In particular, we are focused on the signaling circuitry in pathways involved in cell death and cellular inflammation. We are developing specific cell active enzyme inhibitors or activators by using a novel disulfide trapping technology which allows us to target specific sites on proteins and determine their role in driving cellular signaling processes. This technology allows us to trap allosteric states so that they may be studied by biophysical and mutational means. We are using this approach to determine the role of specific inflammatory caspases via selective inhibitors and study activation of proteins in proliferation and apoptotic pathways via allosteric activators. This approach will identify “orphan allosteric sites’ which may have natural binding partners and pose new targets for drug discovery. In addition, we are developing methods for tagging N-termini of proteins using engineered enzymes so we can follow proteolytic cascades especially those in apoptosis and cellular inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My lab studies the regulation and dynamics of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, particularly how motile cells establish polarity and use actin polymerization to propel themselves forward. This process, called amoeboid motility, is responsible for correct development of multicellular organisms; for wound healing; for proper function of the immune system; and for remodeling and regeneration in the nervous system. Loss of regulation of this process can contribute to invasion and metastasis of cancerous cells so understanding the mechanics and regulation of amoeboid motility is fundamental to understanding many basic biological processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We attack this problem by asking three questions: (1) What are the structures of the macromolecular assemblies that drive cell movement and how do cells construct them? (2) What are the mechanisms by which molecular assemblies generate the force required to deform cell membranes? (3) How do intracellular signaling systems control the assembly and function of these macromolecular machines? The forward, or leading edge of a motile cell is a highly specialized structure - containing an extremely dense meshwork of actin filaments built and maintained by a particular subset of actin-associated proteins. Filaments assemble at the membrane and drive it forward (Mogilner and Oster, Biophys J. 71(6):3030-45, 1996) and behind the advancing membrane filaments are disassembled (Theriot and Mitchison, Nature 352(6331):126-31, 1991) so that the actin network at the leading edge churns forward like a tank tread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not understand exactly how extracellular signals are converted into three dimensional structures that accomplish specific tasks but I suspect that the basic principle, if not the molecular mechanism, is conserved across evolution. We previously proposed a design principle for protrusive structures, called the Dendritic Nucleation Model (Mullins et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. USA 95:6181-6186, 1998). In this model the assembly of individual actin filaments and their organization into higher-order structures are specified simultaneously. This appears to be accomplished in most eukaryotic cells when a single cellular factor, the Arp2/3 complex, initiates polymerization of new actin filaments and simultaneously crosslinks them into networks with unique mechanical properties (Mullins et al., Molec. Biol. Cell. 9:841-852, 1998). In Acanthamoeba castellanii, the Arp2/3 complex is absolutely required for such signal-induced actin polymerization (Mullins and Pollard, Current Biol., 9:405-415, 1999). The Acanthamoeba Arp2/3 complex also crosslinks filaments in a unique end-to-side geometry to create a branching arbor of actin filaments which behaves like a rigid elastic solid.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fujimori received a B.Sc. degree in chemistry from the University of Belgrade, Serbia, and a Ph.D. degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. Prior to joining UCSF as Assistant Professor in 2008, she conducted her postdoctoral research in the lab of Christopher Walsh at Harvard Medical School. Among other awards, Dr. Fujimori is the recipient of an NIH Pathway to Independence Award and the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fujimori Lab studies the mechanistic basis by which members of several enzyme classes regulate biological pathways, including both their catalytic mechanisms and function within a biological system. The overall objective is to uncover disease-associated enzymes that could be used as new therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers, and identify their selective inhibitors. To do so, the lab will develop novel chemical tools to study oxidative enzymatic pathways and carbohydrate-modifying enzymes. In conjunction with biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology techniques, these chemical probes will allow the lab to map the molecular, cellular and (patho)physiological roles of target enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s Spanish for &amp;#8220;I know you speak English?&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t understand the question, and I won&amp;#8217;t respond to it. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn&amp;#8217;t that mean anything anymore? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='exit_strategy'&gt;Exit Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&amp;#8217;t like his trailer. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&amp;#8217;t date magicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a hug, Michael. I&amp;#8217;m hugging you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Well, what do you expect, mother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id='let_em_eat_cake'&gt;Let &amp;#8216;Em Eat Cake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you&amp;#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right. There&amp;#8217;s only one man I&amp;#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&amp;#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&amp;#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Really? Did nothing cancel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id='afternoon_delight'&gt;Afternoon delight&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across from where? I don&amp;#8217;t criticize you! And if you&amp;#8217;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. What&amp;#8217;s Spanish for &amp;#8220;I know you speak English?&amp;#8221; Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight? First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&amp;#8217;t date magicians. Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s called &amp;#8216;taking advantage.&amp;#8217; It&amp;#8217;s what gets you ahead in life.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Whoa, this guy&amp;#8217;s straight?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Guy&amp;#8217;s a pro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id='good_grief'&gt;Good Grief!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say goodbye to these, because it&amp;#8217;s the last time! No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer&amp;#8217;s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. That&amp;#8217;s why you always leave a note! Say goodbye to these, because it&amp;#8217;s the last time!

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Development of Novel Tools to Study Signal Transduction Research in our laboratory is focused on the development of novel chemically based tools to decipher signal transduction pathways on a genome-wide scale. We believe that small-molecule based methods for decoding cell-biology could provide information not currently accessible through solely genetic and biochemical techniques. The key problem with using chemicals (small-molecules) to control processes inside cells is that there are very few molecules that are highly specific for the most interesting proteins. Presently, small-molecules which alter the enzymatic activity or cellular localization of key biological macromolecules are derived from two sources: natural product screening (eg. Taxol, FK506, staurosporine, and others) and drug development efforts (eg. Aspirin, Raloxifine, SKB203580, and others). These two approaches require large commitments of time and resources to find even one specific inhibitor. Our lab has developed a third method for producing these valuable reagents using an approach combining protein design and chemical synthesis. We use protein design to engineer a functionally silent yet structurally significant mutation into the active site of the protein of interest. This mutation could be the substitution of a conserved large residue in the wild-type enzyme for a smaller residue thus creating a new &amp;#8220;pocket&amp;#8221; in the active site. The mutant enzyme is then tested in a relevant cellular system to ensure that it functions in all aspects like the wild-type enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step is the initiation of a chemical design and synthesis project to modify a non-specific inhibitor of the wild-type enzyme with substituents which specifically complement the mutation introduced into the active site of the protein of interest. Substituents with the appropriate chemical functionality that bind to the newly introduced pocket are chemically appended to the origininal inhibitor structure. Importantly, the new substituent is designed to preclude binding of the inhibitor to any wild-type enzymes because they would &amp;#8220;bump&amp;#8221; into the large residue in the wild-type enzyme. This makes choosing a residue that is conserved in the entire protein family critical for the success of the method. We first applied our approach to deciphering the functions of protein kinases. The protein kinases comprise the largest single gene family in the human genome and are components of the signaling apparatus of almost every key cellular response pathway. Using our combined chemical genetic approach we have developed the first method for identifying the direct downstream substrates of protein kinases. Additionally we have developed extremely potent inhibitors of individual protein kinases that are cell permeable and function in transgenic mice. These inhibitors can be used to inhibit any suitably engineered protein kinase to ellucidate the downstream response pathway controlled by that kinase. We are also currently extending our efforts to other large superfamilies of enzymes involved in signal transduction pathways for which specific inhibitors are not available.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bourne received his MD degree from Johns Hopkins and took his postdoctoral training at the National Institutes of Health and UCSF. He came to UCSF in 1969, became a faculty member in the Department of Medicine in 1971, and served as chair of the Department of Pharmacology from 1984 to 1992. Dr. Bourne’s research for many years focused on trimeric G proteins and G protein coupled receptors. During the past five years he has turned his laboratory’s efforts toward dissecting the cellular signals responsible for polarity and direction-finding (chemotaxis) of human leukocytes. Using HL-60 leukemia cells, which can be induced to differentiate into mature neutrophils, Dr. Bourne’s laboratory has shown that attractants trigger polarity by activating opposed “frontness” and “backness” signaling pathways, mediated by different trimeric G proteins and Rho GTPases. These pathways trigger different actin assemblies, which then ‘self-organize’ to create cellular polarity. This polarity is apparently distinct from the neutrophil ‘compass’, which senses and interprets attractant gradients to orient the direction of polarity. At present the laboratory is focusing on the compass mechanism, using drugs, toxins, and RNAi to alter functions of candidate compass components and assessing their effects in attractant gradients created by micropipettes or in microfluidic devices, which create instantaneous, stable gradients of any desired slope or concentration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our overall research interests continue to center on the structure, function and regulation of two physiologically important classes of hepatic hemoproteins: Cytochromes P450 (P450s, CYPs) and tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO). Our specific goals are to: (I) explore and mechanistically characterize the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of proteins by exploiting P450s as cellular models; (II) explore the role of proteasomal processing of P450s in drug-induced immunotoxicity; (III) elucidate the role of heme, if any, on the regulation of P450 synthesis; and (IV) to examine the structure-function relationships and heme-mediated regulation of hepatic hemoprotein tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO). A combination of approaches (enzymological, chemical, structural, cell biological, and molecular biological) are being employed in pursuit of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
