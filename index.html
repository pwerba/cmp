      <h3>Administration</h3>

      CMP is the administrative home to the graduate education program in Chemistry and Chemical Biology. Other graduate studies with Department faculty are carried out within two consortium programs, Biomedical Sciences (BMS) and the Program in Biological Sciences (PIBS); inquiries should be directed to those programs. Inquiries regarding postdoctoral research in CMP should be addressed to individual faculty members. For other information, search this Web Site or contact the CMP administrative staff.

      <h3>Research</h3>

      Research in CMP spans a broad range of fields, including analyses of the mechanisms and biological consequences of the interactions of drugs and other small molecule ligands with receptors, channels, and cellular organelles, hormonal and sensory signal transduction, cytoskeleton-based intracellular motility, cell movement and migration, synaptic transmission and plasticity, protein design and structure prediction, protein folding, structure and function, and RNA-protein interactions. Experimental approaches include genetics, chemistry and crystallography; experimental systems stretch from yeast to human.
