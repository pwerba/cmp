[Danica Fujimori's Lab](https://fujimorilab.ucsf.edu/)
Our lab studies post-translational and post-transcriptional modification of macromolecules, focusing on chromatin and the bacterial ribosome.

We combine chemical biology and biochemistry to investigate the regulatory potential of these modifications and identify chemical tool compounds to correct aberrant modification states.
