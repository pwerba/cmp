<a href="http://bionano.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">Shawn's Lab</a> Our group develops new technologies for science and medicine by drawing inspiration and materials from disciplines including molecular & cellular biology, computer science, physics, and engineering. We create open-source software to support these efforts, and make our work accessible to the broadest possible audience using illustration, animation, and interactive media. One promising avenue that we are pursuing is to assemble DNA into very small (nanoscale) devices to function as medical therapies.
