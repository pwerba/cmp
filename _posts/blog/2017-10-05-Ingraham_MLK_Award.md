Each year [this award](https://diversity.ucsf.edu/community/awards/3297581) recognizes and honors three individuals at UCSF—one faculty, one staff, one student/resident/postdoctoral scholar—who have demonstrated outstanding commitment and service to the ideals of diversity, equity, and inclusion beyond the scope of their job, area of research, or training. "The Dr. Martin Luther King Award is really about someone who goes above and beyond their normal responsibilities here at UCSF to really contribute to increasing the diversity and inclusion here on campus," said Wendell Lim, CMP Chair.

This year, Dr. Holly Ingraham received the faculty award for her efforts to mitigate the lack of diversity among postdoctoral scholars at UCSF. She has run the [IRACDA Program](http://iracda.ucsf.edu/), which offers a 4-year career development opportunity including salary support to facilitate our postdoctoral scholars’ successful transition to pursue independent research and teaching careers in academia. The program offers mentored experience in research, teaching, and research mentoring in partnership with SFSU.
