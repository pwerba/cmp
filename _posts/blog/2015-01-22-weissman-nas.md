### Weissman Wins inaugural "NAS Award for Scientific Discovery"

In 2009, Jonathan Weissman and colleagues reported a method called "Ribosome Profiling" that leverages sequencing technology to determine which messenger RNAs are actively being translated into protein. The method offers a dramatic improvement in sensitivity and resolution over previous techniques.

[Jonathan Weissman's Lab](http://weissmanlab.ucsf.edu/)
is looking at how cells ensure that proteins fold into their correct shape, as well as the role of protein misfolding in disease and normal physiology. They also develop experimental and analytical approaches for exploring the organizational principles of biological systems and globally monitoring protein translation through ribosome profiling.
