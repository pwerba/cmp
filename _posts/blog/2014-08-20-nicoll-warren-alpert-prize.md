### Congratulations to Roger Nicoll for being awarded the 2014 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize.

Roger Nicoll has been awarded the 2014 Warren Alpert Foundation Prize, along with Sol Snyder from Johns Hopkins and Oleh Hornykiewicz of the Medical University of Vienna and U. of Toronto.  The three received this award for their work on neurotransmission and neurodegeneration.

"This award is such a tremendous honor for me," said Nicoll. "Of course, the goal of every real scientist is discovery, experiencing the extreme joy of understanding some biological problem that seems strange and impenetrable. To suddenly be able to explain it, few joys are greater than that. This award validates that weâ€™ve done something beautiful."
