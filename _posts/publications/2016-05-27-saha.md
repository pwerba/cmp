Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive liver bile duct malignancy exhibiting frequent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/IDH2) mutations. Through a high-throughput drug screen of a large panel of cancer cell lines including 17 biliary tract cancers, we found that IDH mutant (IDHm) ICC cells demonstrate a striking response to the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib, with the highest sensitivity among 682 solid tumor cell lines. Using unbiased proteomics to capture the activated kinome and CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing to introduce dasatinib-resistant 'gatekeeper' mutant kinases, we identified SRC as a critical dasatinib target in IDHm ICC. Importantly, dasatinib-treated IDHm xenografts exhibited pronounced apoptosis and tumor regression. Our results show that IDHm ICC cells have a unique dependency on SRC and suggest that dasatinib may have therapeutic benefit against IDHm ICC. Moreover, these proteomic and genome-editing strategies provide a systematic and broadly applicable approach to define targets of kinase inhibitors underlying drug responsiveness.
