Dystrophin is a large, submembrane cytoskeletal protein, absence of which causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a dystrophin homologue found in both muscle and brain whose physiological function is unknown. Recordings of single-channel activity were made from membrane patches on skeletal muscle from mdx, mdx/utrn(+/-) heterozygotes and mdx/utrn(-/-) double knockout mice to investigate the role of these cytoskeletal proteins in mechanosensitive (MS) channel gating. We find complex, gene dose-dependent effects of utrophin depletion in dystrophin-deficient mdx muscle: (1) increased MS channel open probability, (2) a shift of MS channel gating to larger pressures, (3) appearance of modal gating of MS channels and small conductance channels and (4) expression of large conductance MS channels. We suggest a physical model in which utrophin acts as a scaffolding protein that stabilizes lipid microdomains and clusters MS channel subunits. Depletion of utrophin disrupts domain composition in a manner that favours open channel area expansion, as well as allowing diffusion and aggregation of additional MS channel subunits.
