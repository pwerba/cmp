The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored hepatic cytochromes P450 (P450s) are enzymes that metabolize endo- and xenobiotics i.e. drugs, carcinogens, toxins, natural and chemical products. These agents modulate liver P450 content through increased synthesis or reduction via inactivation and/or proteolytic degradation, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions. P450 proteolytic degradation occurs via ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involving either of two distinct routes: Ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent 26S proteasomal degradation (ERAD/UPD) or autophagic lysosomal degradation (ERAD/ALD). CYP3A4, the major human liver/intestinal P450, and the fast-turnover CYP2E1 species are degraded via ERAD/UPD entailing multisite protein phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination by gp78 and CHIP E3 Ub-ligases. We are gaining insight into the nature of the structural determinants involved in CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 molecular recognition in ERAD/UPD [i.e. K48-linked polyUb chains and linear and/or &quot;conformational&quot; phosphodegrons consisting either of consecutive sequences on surface loops and/or disordered regions, or structurally-assembled surface clusters of negatively charged acidic (Asp/Glu) and phosphorylated (Ser/Thr) residues, within or vicinal to which, Lys-residues are targeted for ubiquitination]. Structural inspection of select human liver P450s reveals that such linear or conformational phosphodegrons may indeed be a common P450-ERAD/UPD feature. By contrast, although many P450s such as the slow-turnover CYP2E1 species and rat liver CYP2B1 and CYP2C11 are degraded via ERAD/ALD, little is known about the mechanism of their ALD-targeting. On the basis of our current knowledge of ALD-substrate targeting, we propose a tripartite conjunction of K63-linked Ub-chains, P450 structural &quot;LIR&quot; motifs and selective cellular &quot;cargo receptors&quot; as plausible P450-ALD determinants.
