The molecular mechanism underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) is critical for understanding learning and memory. CaMKII, a key kinase involved in LTP, is both necessary and sufficient for LTP induction. However, how CaMKII gives rise to LTP is currently unknown. Recent studies suggest that Rho GTPases are necessary for LTP. Rho GTPases are activated by Rho guanine exchange factors (RhoGEFs), but the RhoGEF(s) required for LTP also remain unknown. Here, using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging techniques, we show that the RhoGEF Kalirin and its paralog Trio play critical and redundant roles in excitatory synapse structure and function. Furthermore, we show that CaMKII phosphorylation of Kalirin is sufficient to enhance synaptic AMPA receptor expression, and that preventing CaMKII signaling through Kalirin and Trio prevents LTP induction. Thus, our data identify Kalirin and Trio as the elusive targets of CaMKII phosphorylation responsible for AMPA receptor up-regulation during LTP.
