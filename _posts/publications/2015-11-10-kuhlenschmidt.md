Cryptosporidiosis is a serious diarrheal disease in immunocompromised patients and malnourished children, and treatment is complicated by lack of adequate drugs. Recent studies suggest that the natural occurrence of a small gatekeeper residue in the serine threonine calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) in C. parvum might be exploited to target this enzyme and block parasite growth. Here were explored a series of pyrazolopyrimidine analogs, which are selective for small gatekeeper kinases, for their potency in inhibiting CpCDPK1 and blocking C. parvum growth in tissue culture in vitro. Although these compounds were potent at inhibiting kinase activity in vitro, most had no effect on parasite growth. Moreover, among those that were active against parasite growth, there was a very poor correlation with IC50 values against the enzyme. Active compounds also had no effect on cell invasion, unlike the situation in T. gondii where these compounds block CDPK1, prevent microneme secretion, and disrupt cell invasion. These finding suggest that CPDK1 is not essential for host cell invasion or growth in C. parvum and therefore that it is not optimal target for therapeutic intervention. Nonetheless, several inhibitors with low micromolar EC50 values were identified, and these may affect other essential targets in C. parvum that are worth further exploration.
