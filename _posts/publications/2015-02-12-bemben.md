Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a highly heritable, multifarious group of neurodevelopmental disorders, which are characterized by repetitive behaviors and impairments in social interactions. Point mutations have been identified in X-linked Neuroligin (NLGN) 3 and 4X genes in patients with ASDs and all of these reside in their extracellular domains except for a single point mutation in the cytoplasmic domain of NLGN4X in which an arginine is mutated to a cysteine (R704C). Here we show that endogenous NLGN4X is robustly phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) at T707, and R704C completely eliminates T707 phosphorylation. Endogenous NLGN4X is intensely phosphorylated on T707 upon PKC stimulation in human neurons. Furthermore, a phospho-mimetic mutation at T707 has a profound effect on NLGN4X-mediated excitatory potentiation. Our results now establish an important interplay between a genetic mutation, a key posttranslational modification, and robust synaptic changes, which can provide insights into the synaptic dysfunction of ASDs.
