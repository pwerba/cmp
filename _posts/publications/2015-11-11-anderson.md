p97 is a AAA-ATPase with multiple cellular functions, one of which is critical regulation of protein homeostasis pathways. We describe the characterization of CB-5083, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of p97. Treatment of tumor cells with CB-5083 leads to accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, retention of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates, and generation of irresolvable proteotoxic stress, leading to activation of the apoptotic arm of the unfolded protein response. In xenograft models, CB-5083 causes modulation of key p97-related pathways, induces apoptosis, and has antitumor activity in a broad range of both hematological and solid tumor models. Molecular determinants of CB-5083 activity include expression of genes in the ERAD pathway, providing a potential strategy for patient selection.
