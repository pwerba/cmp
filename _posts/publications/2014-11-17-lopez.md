Analog-sensitive AS Kinase technology allows for rapid, reversible, and highly specific inhibition of individual engineered kinases in cells and in mouse models of human diseases. The technique consists of two parts: a kinase containing a space-creating mutation in the ATP-binding pocket and a bulky ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor that complements the shape of the mutant ATP pocket. This strategy enables dissection of phospho-signaling pathways, elucidation of the physiological function of individual kinases, and characterization of the pharmacology of clinical-kinase inhibitors. Here, we present an overview of AS technology and describe a stepwise approach for generating AS Kinase mutants and identifying appropriate small molecule inhibitors. We also describe commonly encountered technical obstacles and provide strategies to overcome them.
