RNA methylation is an abundant modification identified in various RNA species in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. However, the functional roles for the majority of these methylations remain largely unclear. In eukaryotes, many RNA methylations have been suggested to participate in fundamental cellular processes. Mutations in eukaryotic RNA methylating enzymes, and a consequent change in methylation, can lead to the development of diseases and disorders. In contrast, loss of RNA methylation in prokaryotes can be beneficial to microorganisms, especially under antibiotic pressure. Here we discuss several recent advances in understanding mutational landscape of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA methylating enzymes and their relevance to disease and antibiotic resistance.
