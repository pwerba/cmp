Reid and Nicchitta propose that most cellular translation is carried out by a noncycling pool of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes. However, proximity-specific ribosome profiling data place an upper bound of about 7 to 16% on the fraction of cytosolic protein translation carried out by ribosomes accessible to ER-tethered biotin ligases. Moreover, yeast pulse-labeling experiments argue against there being a static population of ER-associated ribosomes.
