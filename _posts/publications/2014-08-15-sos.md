Despite the development of potent RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, only a fraction of BRAF-mutant patients benefit from treatment with these drugs. Using a combined chemogenomics and chemoproteomics approach, we identify drug-induced RAS-RAF-MEK complex formation in a subset of BRAF-mutant cancer cells characterized by primary resistance to vemurafenib. In these cells, autocrine interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion may contribute to the primary resistance phenotype via induction of JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. InÂ a subset of cell lines, combined IL-6/MAPK inhibition is able to overcome primary resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. Overall, we show that the signaling plasticity exerted by primary resistant BRAF-mutant cells is achieved by their ability to mimic signaling features of oncogenic RAS, a strategy that we term &quot;oncogene mimicry.&quot; This model may guide future strategies for overcoming primary resistance observed in these tumors.
