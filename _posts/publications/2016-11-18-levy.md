Fast excitatory transmission in the brain requires localization of glutamate receptors to synapses. The MAGUK family of synaptic scaffolding proteins is critical for localization of glutamate receptors to synapses. Although the MAGUKs are well-studied in reduced preparations and young animals, little data exists on their role in adult animals. Here, we present a detailed developmental study of the role of the MAGUKs during rat development. We first confirm by knockdown experiments that MAGUKs are essential for glutamatergic transmission in young animals and cultured slices, and increases in PSD-95 by overexpression causes correlated increases in glutamatergic transmission. We find that CA1 synapses in adults, in contrast, are largely unaffected by overexpression of MAGUKs, and although adult CA1 synapses require MAGUKs to the same degree as synapses in young animals, this is only apparent over long time scales of knockdown. We additionally show that overexpression of MAGUKs likely functions to accelerate the developmental strengthening of excitatory transmission. Finally, we show that adult dentate gyrus appears similar to immature CA1, demonstrating regional and developmental control of MAGUK dynamics. Together, these results demonstrate a period of juvenile instability at CA1 synapses, followed by a period of adult stability in which synapses are acutely unaffected by changes in MAGUK abundance.
