This protocol includes two methods for genomic DNA preparation from Schizosaccharomyces pombe The first is a quick method for preparation of DNA suitable for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping. The second, longer method yields high-quality DNA that can be used for amplification of targeting cassettes.
