Recognition of histone marks by &quot;reader&quot; modules is thought to be at the heart of epigenetic mechanisms. These protein domains are considered to function by targeting regulators to chromosomal loci carrying specific histone modifications. This is important for proper gene regulation as well as propagation of epigenetic information. The NuA4 acetyltransferase complex contains two of these reader modules, an H3K4me3-specific PHD domain within the Yng2 subunit and an H3K36me2/3-specific chromodomain in the Eaf3 subunit. While each domain shows a close functional interaction with the respective histone mark it recognizes, at the biochemical, genetic (E-MAP) and phenotypic levels, the combined loss of both readers shows greatly enhanced phenotypes. ChIP-seq experiments demonstrate that Yng2 PHD specifically directs H4 acetylation near the transcription start site of highly expressed genes while Eaf3 is important downstream on the body of the genes. Strikingly, the recruitment of the NuA4 complex to these loci is not significantly affected. Furthermore, RNA polymerase II occupancy is decreased only in conditions where both PHD and chromo domains are lost, and generally in the second half of the gene coding regions. Altogether, these results argue that methylated histone reader modules in NuA4 are not responsible for its recruitment to the promoter or coding regions but rather to orient its acetyltransferase catalytic site to the methylated H3-bearing nucleosomes in the surrounding chromatin, cooperating to allow proper transition from transcription initiation to elongation.
