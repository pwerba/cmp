The catalytic activity of Zap70 is crucial for T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling, but the quantitative and temporal requirements for its function in thymocyte development are not known. Using a chemical-genetic system to selectively and reversibly inhibit Zap70 catalytic activity in a model of synchronized thymic selection, we showed that CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes integrate multiple, transient, Zap70-dependent signals over more than 36 h to reach a cumulative threshold for positive selection, whereas 1 h of signaling was sufficient for negative selection. Titration of Zap70 activity resulted in graded reductions in positive and negative selection but did not decrease the cumulative TCR signals integrated by positively selected OT-I cells, which revealed heterogeneity, even among CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes expressing identical TCRs undergoing positive selection.
