Pathogens usurp a variety of host pathways via protein-protein interactions to ensure efficient pathogen replication. Despite the existence of an impressive toolkit of systematic and unbiased approaches, we still lack a comprehensive list of these PPIs and an understanding of their functional implications. Here, we highlight the importance of harnessing genetic diversity of hosts and pathogens for uncovering the biochemical basis of pathogen restriction, virulence, fitness, and pathogenesis. We further suggest that integrating physical interaction data with orthogonal types of data will allow researchers to draw meaningful conclusions both for basic and translational science.
