The Weinberg Lab was established at UCSF in September 2013 through the Sandler Fellows Program. Our lab is taking a multidisciplinary approach to understand the molecular basis of translational control and the interplay between translation and mRNA decay. More generally, we are interested in the diverse mechanisms of gene regulation that operate at the post-transcriptional level.
